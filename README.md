# JSBot
A javascript based botnet/C&amp;C to remotely manage/control browsers.


Instalation Instructions
------------------------
1. Upload the filed to your domain you plan to use to host the panel
2. Run and go through the steps in 'install.php' (Note, no need to create an SQL database or anything of the like as this is powered by PHD)
3. After that, delete the 'install.php' file, and log into your panel.

There will be a link to the js server file you can include in a web page if you want to monitor visitors, and there will also be a link in the panel to download an automatically created universal browser plugin which you can load into Chrome, Firefox, or Edge to control.

DISCLAIMER
----------
Be responsible, because I take no responsibility for the misuse of JSBot.
